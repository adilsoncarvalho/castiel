# Castiel

[Castiel](http://va.mu/cUmX) was written to rescue me from hell every time I have to write any kind
of script that must deal with dates and times to be parsed on command line.

It is common to me to write summarization daemons that must accept command lines like:

`sales-count yesterday`

or

`hit-count yesterday today 11..17`

## Installation
